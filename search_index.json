Yet most researchers are\nnot taught to do this!\nA course to tackle this problem was developed and run by Greg Wilson and Brent Gorda in 1998.\nFrom the delivery of this course they learnt that:\n-- Slide --\nLesson 1\n\nWeek long courses frazzle the attendees brains\nTextbook SLDC1 is not useful to researchers\n\n1: Software Development Life Cycle\n-- Slide End --\nObservation A day of the cloud starter training leaves people feeling frazzled!\nSubsequent to this the course materials were put on line.

Just keeps on interfering :(\n\n-- Slide End --\nFrom this came the realization:\n-- Slide --\nLesson 3: MOOCs!\n\nVideo&#39;s are a huge amount of effort\nMost people don&#39;t complete the courses\n\n-- Slide End --\nHow learning works\nThe team behind Software Carpentry constantly attempt to incorporate and build the findings of current research on \nlearning into their material.\nSo how do we learn?\n-- Slide --\nAnalogies\nStudents learn new ideas by building on what they know.\n-- Slide End --\nThis can be both a help and a hindrance.\nA help if their existing knowledge is good.\nA hindrance otherwise.\nSo our material tries to:\n\nUse analogies that students are likely to understand\nIntroduce concepts in sequence, building on what has gone before\n\n-- Slide --\nMemory\nFrom Working -&gt; Long Term\n-- Slide End --\nWorking memory has very limited capacity.\nSo our material:\n\nUses scaffolding to reduce cognitive overload\nBut gradually removes the scaffolding\nAnd should be well paced\n\n-- Slide --\nWhere did I put my keys?\nWhat goes into memory often vanishes almost straight away\n-- Slide End --\nWe address this by\n\nAsking questions\nTelling stories\nIf needed, we can introduce mnemonics (we haven&#39;t needed to yet)\nRepetition giving practice\n\n-- Slide --\nPractice is good\nBut not all practice is equivalent.\n-- Slide End --\n\nSpaced practice is good\nQuizzes help\nInterleaving practice is more effective\n\n-- Slide --\nFeedback is needed\nAnd it should be:\n\nSpecific\nClear\nFocused on the task\nExplanatory\n\n-- Slide End --\nAll of this is the inverse of http://www.barbaraoakley.com/pdf/10rulesofstudying.pdf, really.\nSo after years of effort, review, and development, Software Carpentry now has the following format:\n-- Slide --\nFormat\n\nA two day workshop\nCovering a small set of tools\nThat introduce high level concepts\nWith the goal of teaching computational competence\n\n-- Slide End --\nThe following guidelines are in place\n-- Slide --\nGuidelines\n\nNo more than 40 people in a workshop\nIf possible, parallel sessions, with attendees streamed by ability\n\nIf parallel sessions are run, then:\n\nA pre-assessment questionnaire is used to create the groups\nPeople are not swapped from group to group\n\n-- Slide End --\nThe workshops aim to have:\n-- Slide --\nStaffing\n\nAn instructor up front\nAt least 1 roaming helper per 8 attendees\n\n-- Slide End --\nObservation We have found that the more helpers we have the smoother the day!\nFeedback\nExtensive use is made of feedback loops.\n-- Slide --\nFeedback loops\n\nSticky notes\nMinute cards\nSummary feedback\nPost workshop assessments\n\n-- Slide End --\nSticky notes are handed out to learners:\n\ntwo different colours (typically, Red and Green)\nused for true/false answers\nto show pain if not not coping\nand to signal that activities are completed\n\nMinute cards:\nBefore each break the learners are asked to write one thing:\n\nthat they&#39;ve learnt on their green sticky note\nthat they found confusing on their red sticky note\n\nThe instructor then collates these and incorporates the feedback into the next iteration of the lessons.\nSummary feedback at the end of the day:\nEvery attendee is asked to stand and to give one good point about the day, and one negative point,\nwithout repeating what has already been said. The instructor makes notes and incorporates the\nfeedback into the next iteration.\nPost workshop assessments:\nAfter the workshop an assessment is sent to the attendees. \nObservation These don&#39;t have high return rates.\nInstructors are also requested to provide feedback in debriefing sessions.\n-- Slide --\nWe really like\n\nMultiple choice questions\n\n-- Slide End --\nWe find that not only do they help us with seeing if the students understand the material, they also act as\npunctuation marks in the lessons that engage the students.\nWe have found it really hard to design good questions, though...\n-- Slide --\nDelivery\n\nLive coding\nTwo devices for the instructor\nAn Etherpad session\nLearners work on their own machines\nPair programming (so dinner table style rooms over lecture theaters)\n\n-- Slide End --\nLive coding because it is good to demonstrate to the learners that experts make mistakes.\nTwo devices: one for the lesson plan, and one for the overhead projector.\nEtherpads help to share links and also do encourage engagement between the students.\nObservation Pair programming: we only use this if people have trouble logging on or don&#39;t have their own computers.\nObservation We find it really good if the instructor leaves the podium and wanders around during the exercises. \nThis stops the students from focusing on the front of the class. There seems to be some kind of weird leadership \nthing in play?\n-- Slide --\nSWC: biggest challenges\n\nAre they truly helping researchers?\nDiversity of learners - 20% bored, 20% lost :(\nPeople don&#39;t contribute back...\n\n-- Slide End --\nObservation  We have the diversity of learners, but we don&#39;t suffer the problem of boredom.\nSo\nSoftware carpentry has been under continuous iterative development for many years now. Along the\nway the material has been reworked to take into account the latest in educational research and\nfeedback from the actual delivery.\nBTW, Software Carpentry material is licenced under a creative commons licence. Anyone is free to use it.\nNB But you are not free to use their name and logo! There are strict conditions applied to this.

Then the group will work through\nthe lesson plan and associated lesson. We&#39;ll take, say, 45 minutes to do this.\nThen we will meet up again and try presenting our material for a short period.\nAs we work through this, I want you all to note any errors or changes that need to be done to the course material.\nBy raising issues!\n-- Slide --\nDo you know how to raise an issue on GitHub?\n\nG = Yes.\nR = No.\n\n-- Slide End --\nIf there are any No&#39;s: well, they need to be shown!\n-- Slide --\nTrue or False: Memory records exactly what we experience...\n\nG = True.\nR = False.\n\n-- Slide End --\nA False - Sadly it&#39;s been proved that not only is our memory of what we experience highly unreliable, it&#39;s even\npossible to plant false remembered experiences through clever questions.\n-- Slide --\nBTW - who has seen this:\n\n\n-- Slide End --\nOnce you&#39;ve worked through your chosen lesson and think you are ready to present hold up a Green sticky note!\nRemember, the easy thing about software carpentry is that you can present with the lesson right up\nin front of you. So you don&#39;t have to memorize anything.\nI&#39;ve seen people go as far as reading from the lesson.\nI try not to: I try to keep the notes to one side, and to glance at them from time to time. I do scribble highlights\nof important stuff on them so I don&#39;t miss it.\nThe more familiar I am with material the less I need to look at the material.\nBut I plead guilty to putting extra slides up just to keep me on track...\nTake break while people go through the lessons\nImproving our teaching\nBefore we actually try presenting lets talk about improving our teaching.\nWe all have unconscious nervous habits. I used to rock backward and forwards.\nWhen that was pointed out to me I stopped doing it. Then I started wringing my hands instead.\nThat was pointed out to. I stopped doing it. Then I started to rock from side to side.\nThat was pointed out to me...\nWhat I&#39;m trying to say here is that I need constant input on what I&#39;m doing, and how I can improve on it.\nWhen I was first told about my rocking from side to side, I was horrified. I took it personally.\n&quot;What did people think of me? I must have looked odd!&quot;\nBut the more feedback I&#39;ve got, the more I&#39;ve learnt to not take it personally: to rather find it interesting.\nIn a scientific way. I&#39;ve found that rather than wondering what people think of me, by trying to understand\nwhy I&#39;m doing these oddities, the easier it is to tackle them.\nThe reason I&#39;m giving you this viewpoint is that you should solicit feedback about your teaching if you want to\nimprove. And that it&#39;s just once person&#39;s point of view. Try not to take it personally. Understand it. If it has\nmerit try to fix it. If it doesn&#39;t, note it. It&#39;s just how you improve!\nAnd remember, just have we have points for improvement, we also have things we do really well.\nSo I ask for feedback in order to improve: but I always ask for one point of improvement, and for one thing\nthat I&#39;ve done really well. That way I keep my equilibrium.\nNever teach alone if you can help it! And solicit feedback from your fellow teachers!\nSo now we are going to take turns in teaching a short extract from each of our chosen lessons.\nWork out a suitable time for each person to teach for\nAt the end of each timed session we the learners will give the teacher a heads up on one thing we thought they\ncan improve on, and the one thing that they do really well. Just for practice.\nIf there are a large number of teachers, do a random sampling\nFinally, before we launch into this practice:\n-- Slide --\nNerves!\n-- Slide End --\nI get stage fright: how do I handle it?\nThere&#39;s a very simple technique.\n-- Slide --\n&quot;You’re Excited, Not Nervous.

If you don&#39;t take control, people just leave them \nup (or down) and it can get very confusing.\nMulti choice questions\nThe multi-choice questions also give a really good idea as to who needs more explanation. They also allow\nus to break up the proceedings with some humour.\nThe multi choice question answer cards are a real pain to manage and distribute. Having each answer a different\ncolour works really well in allowing us to see who has answered what without having to read the cards.\nMinute cards\nWe use minute cards: at the end of a session, learners write one thing\n\nthat they&#39;ve learnt on their green sticky note\nthat they found confusing or think could be improved on their red sticky note\n\nObservation To repeat, we&#39;ve found that the use of minute cards is brilliant.
