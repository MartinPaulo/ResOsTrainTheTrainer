# How learning works

Software Carpentry attempts to build on the findings of current research.

So:

-- *Slide* --

## Analogies

Students learn new ideas by building on what they know.

-- *Slide End* --

This can be both a help and a hindrance.

A help if their existing knowledge is good.
A hindrance otherwise.

So our material must:

* Use analogies that students are likely to understand
* Introduce concepts in sequence, building on what has gone before

-- *Slide* --

## Memory

From Working -> Long Term

-- *Slide End* --

Working memory has very limited capacity.

So our material:

* Can use scaffolding to reduce cognitive overload
* But must gradually remove scaffolding
* Should use multiple modalities (but don't split students attention)
* Must be well paced.


-- *Slide* --

## Where did I put my keys?

What goes into memory often vanishes almost straight away

-- *Slide End* --

We can address this by

* Asking questions
* Telling stories
* Introducing mnemonics

-- *Slide* --

## Practice is good

But not all practice is equivalent.

-- *Slide End* --

* Spaced practice is good
* Quizzes help
* Interleaving practice is more effective

-- *Slide* --

## Feedback is needed

And it should be:

* Specific
* Clear
* Focused on the task
* Explanatory

-- *Slide End* --

All of this is the inverse of http://www.barbaraoakley.com/pdf/10rulesofstudying.pdf, really.
