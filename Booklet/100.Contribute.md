# How to contribute changes back to the course

Why are we telling you all of this?

Well, we'd like you to help us improve the material in the course.

And this stuff helps with course preparation.

But in contributing back, we don't want to be as painful as the tier 0 documentation was!

### Has anyone edited tier 0 documentation?

* <span style="color:white;background:red">R</span> = No

-- *Slide End* --

So either:

* submit a bug report

Or we are thinking:

* fork the repository, make your fix and submit a pull request.

If following the latter course, it would be good to discuss your fixes first if they make a lot of changes.

We have a slack group. I'm uncertain about its value

**DISCUSS** thoughts about this, and also about a support group vs. mailing list.
