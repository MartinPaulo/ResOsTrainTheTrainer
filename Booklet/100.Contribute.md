# How to contribute changes back to the course

Why are we telling you all of this?

Well, we'd like you to help us improve the material in the course.

And this stuff helps with course preparation.

But in contributing back, we don't want to as painful as the tier 0 documentation!

### Has anyone edited tier 0 documentation?

* <span style="color:white;background:red">R</span> = No

So either:

* submit a bug report

Or we are thinking:

* fork the repository, make your fix and submit a pull request.

If following the latter course, it would be good to discuss your fixes first if they make a lot of changes.

**DISCUSS** thoughts about this, and also about a support group vs. mailing list.
