# Preparing to present

The course itself has a set of instructions on its home page.

But we have an extended "checklist" on the readme of this course.

### Experiences 

* Learners who don't read/follow the prerequisites
* Learners who can't install software on their machine
* Learners who don't have AAF access
* Learners who have exhausted their private tenancies
* Network access: XP doesn't work too well these days!

The Tasmanian "Meet and Greet" worked very well IMHO. 

The AAF access: it is handy to have a spare AAF VHO organization for people who don't have AAF access.

Private tenancies: At UoM we have a special training tenancy to add people to on the day if need be. We did worry that
the notes might lead to naming collisions in this instance, but so far we've been lucky.

The network: At UoM we are lucky enough to have a training room with it's own WiFi account. But even that didn't 
initial work with the XP laptop.
