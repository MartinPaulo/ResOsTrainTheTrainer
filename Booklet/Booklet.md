## In the beginning was ResBaz

ResBaz (the [Research Bazaar](http://melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/)) is a campaign, a community and conference.

-- *Slide End* --

A campaign: to provide free peer to peer training on digital skills to researchers.
A community: to provide support to researchers through collaboration.
A conference: an annual 3 day multi city event to kick start the campaign and the community.

-- *Slide* --

## We noticed

That an increasing number of researchers were turning to the cloud

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## We realized

There was a training gap

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## Hence

We developed a course

-- *Slide End* --

We delivered an introduction to the NeCTAR cloud ResBaz 2015 in Melbourne.

As ResBaz makes heavy use of Software Carpentry, we thought to emulate its style and practices.

We also came up with a conceit. A handle we call:

-- *Slide* --

## What is ResOS?

ResOS == Researcher Operating System

-- *Slide End* --

ResOS is simply metaphor to make it easy to communicate with the community on how a cloud operating system works
the same way that operating systems on laptops and mobile phones work.

Hopefully, everyone knows what an "operating system" is....

BTW, The engine which runs ResOS is called OpenStack.

Coincidentally, CSIRO, NASA and CERN all use the "cloud operating system" we teach.

Subsequent to that initial ResBaz event we were commissioned to expand and enhance that material into a full day
hands on course.

So some of our foundations precede the online NeCTAR training material created by Intersect. We had to aligned
the two by changing our material. Which we were only able to do after Intersect published their training.

We've piloted all the material by giving lessons to small numbers of researchers, and solicited their feedback.

We are now starting to use it in training at the University of Melbourne. And we will be changing it and
incorporating what we learn from delivering it as we go forward.

-- *Slide* --

## ResOS: what is it?

1. Researcher Open Source
1. Researcher Onion Storage
1. Researcher Open Storage
1. Researcher Operating System
1. A conceit

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer: D & E** I have such mixed feelings about this term. But it's one that some people have taken to heart.

# Software Carpentry: an overview

**NB** ResOS training is *not* a Software Carpentry course.

-- *Slide End* --

## History

Given that we based our training on we learnt from Software Carpentry, you should know a bit about Software Carpentry,
and the ideas behind it.

Software carpentry grew from the realization that researchers need to install and maintain software:
not only that - they need to occasionally write, debug and test it as well. Yet most researchers are
not taught to do this!

A course to tackle this problem was developed and run by Greg Wilson and Brent Gorda in 1998.

From the delivery of this course they learnt that:

-- *Slide* --

## Lesson 1

* Week long courses frazzle the attendees brains
* Textbook SLDC<sup>1</sup> is not useful to researchers

1: [Software Development Life Cycle](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_overview.htm)

-- *Slide End* --

**Discussion**  Try to have a discussion about the SLDC, and why this might be.

Subsequent to this the course materials were put on line. Other iterations followed.

During this period it was realized that:

-- *Slide* --

## Lesson 2

* Most computer scientists don't have an interest in solving this problem
* The target market is new postgraduates

-- *Slide End* --

MOOC style courses were also attempted. From this came the realization:

-- *Slide* --

## Lesson 3: The MOOC<sup>1</sup>

* Video's are a huge amount of effort
* Most people don't complete the courses

1: Massive Open Online Courses

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## Who's done a MOOC?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes!
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No: why would I?

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## Who's finished all the MOOC's they have started?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes!
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = Life. Just keeps on interfering :(

-- *Slide End* --

After years of effort, review, and development, Software Carpentry now has the following format:

-- *Slide* --

## Format

* A two day workshop
* Covering a small set of tools
* That introduce high level concepts
* With the goal of teaching computational competence

-- *Slide End* --

The following guidelines are in place

-- *Slide* --

## Guidelines

* No more than 40 people in a workshop
* If possible, parallel sessions, with attendees streamed by ability

If parallel sessions are run, then:

* A pre-assesment questionnaire is used to create the groups
* People are not swapped from group to group

-- *Slide End* --

The workshops aim to have:

-- *Slide* --

## Staffing

* An instructor up front
* At least 1 helper per 8 attendees

-- *Slide End* --

Group sign up leads to better workshops and better attendance by under represented groups

-- *Slide* --

## Feedback loops

* Sticky notes
* Minute cards
* Summary feedback
* Post workshop assesments

-- *Slide End* --

Sticky notes are handed out to learners:

* two different colours (typically, Red and Green)
* used for true/false answers
* to show pain if not not coping
* and to signal that activities are completed

Minute cards:

Before each break the learners are asked to write one thing:

* that they've learnt on their green sticky note
* that they found confusing on their red sticky note

The instructor then collates these and incorporates the feedback into the next iteration.

Summary feedback at the end of the day:

Every attendee is asked to stand and to give one good point about the day, and one negative point,
without repeating what has already been said. The instructor makes notes and incorporates the
feedback into the next iteration.

Post workshop assessments:

After the workshop an assessment is sent to the attendees. These don't have high return rates.
Instructors are also requested to provide feedback in debriefing sessions.

-- *Slide* --

## To which we've added

* Multi choice questions

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## Delivery

* Live coding
* Two devices for the instructor
* An Etherpad session
* Learners work on their own machines
* Pair programming (so dinner table style rooms over lecture theaters)

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## Biggest challenges

* Are they truly helping researchers?
* Diversity of learners - 20% bored, 20% lost :(
* People don't contribute back...

-- *Slide End* --

## So

Software carpentry has been under continuous iterative development for many years now. Along the
way the material has been reworked to take into account the latest in educational research and
feedback from the actual delivery.

BTW, Software Carpentry material is licenced under a creative commons logo. Anyone is free to use it.

**NB** But you are not free to use their name and logo! There are strict conditions applied to this. They
want to maintain their good name and reputation!

We feel that if you haven't done it yet, that you should sign up for their trainers course!

# Myths and truths about learning and education

Software Carpentry have mailing lists. And some of the discussions and books that are pointed to are
very interesting.

So lets get our sticky notes out and practice with some fun things we've learnt from the mailing lists.

-- *Slide* --

## People have different learning styles

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** False - it's true that we have preferred learning styles. But our preferred learning style
is probably not be our best learning style...

Further, learning styles are typically given a granular nature and labelled ("Visual!", "Auditory"), but us humans
actually form a continuum. Preparing lessons for a label short changes the continuum.

-- *Slide* --

## Physical activity helps learning

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** True - Activity makes for a healthy brain. Especially true for children!

-- *Slide* --

## Google makes learning obsolete!

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** False - Would you let a brain surgeon near you who going to Google every step of your operation along the way?
I wouldn't...

We need context and a mental structure to make sense of the facts we find on the Internet. Context and structure
we get from learning... In fact, given the amount of information available on the Internet we might need more
learning to make sense of it all!

-- *Slide* --

## Knowledge: as perishable as a fresh fish!

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** False - Is the knowledge that you have, somehow, in some strange quantum way, flipping from correct to wrong
with the passage of time?

Or is it simply that the knowledge available is exploding? Sure, some of the knowledge we may hold dear may turn out
to be incorrect (Carbs are good for you?), but the majority still holds true. Pythagoras still Rulez!

-- *Slide* --

## Discovery trumps explanation

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** True and False - Both sides have a point. If you can learn quantum physics by discovery: well, why are you
in this room? Research has shown that pure discovery learning doesn't work: but guided investigative learning can be
very effective in certain settings.

-- *Slide* --

## Memory records exactly what we experience...

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** False - Sadly it's been proved that not only is our memory of what we experience highly unreliable, it's even
possible to plant false remembered experiences through clever questions.

-- *Slide* --

## BTW - who has seen this:

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vJG698U2Mvo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## We only use 10% of our brain...

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** False: If true, we should be able to survive the loss of 90% of our brain quite happily...

Also, modern scanning techniques have shown that this is false. Simple activities, such as walking into a room
full of people, or playing a musical instrument, cause all of your brain to light up!

# How learning works

Software Carpentry attempts to build on the findings of current research.

So:

## Analogies

Students learn new ideas by building on what they know.

This can be both a help and a hindrance.

A help if their existing knowledge is good.
A hindrance otherwise.

So our material must:

* Use analogies that students are likely to understand
* Introduce concepts in sequence, building on what has gone before

## Memory

From Working -> Long Term

Working memory has very limited capacity.

So our material:

* Can use scaffolding to reduce cognitive overload
* But must gradually remove scaffolding
* Should use multiple modalities (but don't split students attention)
* Must be well paced.

## Where did I put my keys?

What goes into memory often vanishes almost straight away

We can address this by

* Asking questions
* Telling stories
* Introducing mnemonics

## Practice is good

But not all practice is equivalent.

* Spaced practice is good
* Quizzes help
* Interleaving practice is more effective

## Feedback is needed

And it should be:

* Specific
* Clear
* Focused on the task
* Explanatory

## Why are we telling you all of this?

Well, we'd like you to help us improve the material in the course.

So we've created a checklist. As we work through the next section, please use the checklist

> "We are ... looking to find (and train) what we are calling a "power (researcher) users".

> Our investigation into these types of users produce the following kind of persona traits (which is whom we are aiming
> this "ResOS Train the Trainer curriculum").  "Power (Researcher) Users" are the types of researchers who see
> themselves as:
>
>* technically savvy (the person in the lab who everyone goes to for help);
>* they feel they are researcher first and foremost, e.g. they usually introduce themselves as "researchers" but are
>  very happy for their research colleagues to identify them as "technical".
>* sometimes these users are hired for their technical skills and identified as the research groups developer, but they
>  do have discipline expertise.
>* often they are a postgraduate or early career researcher; far too often they are male.
>* types of people who immediately un-installed the operating systems which the University provided them on their
>  laptop and replaced it with an OS which allowed them to have access to the "Utilities", "Settings" and
>  "Advanced Settings" of their Operating System.
>* they've even played around with installing Linux Ubuntu and other "command line" tasks.
>* while they understand the basics of installing an OS, it is only a means to an end so they can access more of the
>  research tools which get them and their colleagues results.
>* for them the cloud is just someone else's computer and they are only just willing to trust a computer the University
>  runs so long as no restrictions are made on them about how they use it (they are glad to go back to doing it
>  themselves if there are any barriers or bureaucracy put up by the University).


# Personas: an introduction

Now, break up into groups of 3-4 people.

The first exercise that I want you to do as a group is to develop a persona.

"What's a persona?" I think I hear you ask.

A persona is the representation of the goals and behaviour of a group of hypothetical users.

The theory is that by understanding the needs and abilities of that persona, you can better satisfy the needs and
abilities of the larger group.

A good persona should represent a skill set and a behaviour pattern - not a job description.

By example, here's a persona that I developed:

-- *Slide* --
**Name:**  Associate Professor Glenn Bording

**Job title:**  Senior researcher and lecturer, Radio Astronomy group

**Demographics:**

* 40 years old
* Programming experience in C and Fortran
* Basic HPC experience
* Prefers to work with physical hardware

-- *Slide End* --
-- *Slide* --

**Background:**

* While preparing a new course for undergraduates, developed a computing challenge to support research using real data
* Realised the BYOD for most students were not powerful enough
* Labs not suitable for task
* Teaching parallel programming and getting accounts for students would be difficult
* Heard about the research cloud

**Goal:**

* Now keen to learn about ResOS to see if it solves this problem.

-- *Slide End* --

Once you, as a group, have agreed on your persona, hold up a green sticky note. But you'd better be quick, because
I'm giving you only 5 minutes!

For more on personas, there is the [wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_%28user_experience%29) and of
course, the book [The Inmates are Running the Asylum](http://www.amazon.com/The-Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum/dp/0672326140).
Also, the blog posting [Perfecting Your Persona's](http://www.cooper.com/journal/2001/08/perfecting_your_personas)
And dont' forget: [Software Carpentry's Personas](http://software-carpentry.org/audience/).

Ok: for our purposes today, the persona's that you have developed represent the people that you will be delivering
our ResOS training course to.

So as we go through the rest of today I want each group to ask themselves just what it would take to communicate
the concepts or  activities we are covering to this persona.

If you find you can't do it, then stop me, and we will all discuss it and see if we can come up with a better approach.

**Ask for one or two persona's to be read out**

# The format of the course material

We have elected to write our course material in Markdown.

-- *Slide* --

## Do you know what markdown is?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

**NB** If there are any "No's" you have to explain markdown...

The following may help:

HTML is simply text with tags in it.

**Draw:**

    <h1>A Heading</h1>
    <p>Paragraph text

Your browser parses the text and then renders it appropriately. But all those tags are a pain to type.
Hence markdown: the lazy way of generating HTML. You write:

    #A heading

    Paragraph text

And feed it into an engine, and out comes beautifully formed HTML.

-- *Slide* --

## Open the following site:

http://markdown-here.com/livedemo.html

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = I'm ready to proceed.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = What: there is no such site!

-- *Slide End* --

Pair up!

And see if you can produce the following well turned out html

-- *Slide* --

# This is a heading

Followed by a **paragraph**

### and a subheading

* with a bullet
* list

```bash
# this is pretty printed bash code
ls -al
```

-- *Slide End* --

Hold up a green card when you are done

And a red card if you want help...

**Demonstrate** Show that you can type raw html into the markdown by adding

    <a href="http://www.nectar.org.au">Nectar</a>

And that's about the level of markdown you need to know to work on and understand the training material.

# How to access the course material

The course material is kept under version control.

-- *Slide* --

## Do you know what git is?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

**NB** If there are any "No's" you have to explain git...

The following may help:

* https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control
* https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics

-- *Slide* --

## Which of these is false:

Git:

1. Is a version control system
1. Is a distributed version control system
1. Is able to run offline
1. Has three states for files: modified, staged, committed
1. Can do your head in...

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer** I believe them all to be true...
Any wrong answers here should require further discussion...

Not only is the course material kept under version control: that version control is accessible via an online
repository, so you can revisit it at any time, use it as a stand alone course if you want to, and even, hopefully,
contributes changes and extensions back!

The repository can be found at: https://github.com/resbaz/nectar-cloud-lessons

To check it out we do the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/resbaz/nectar-cloud-lessons.git
```

**Question** Can you check the lessons out?

Hold up a green card when you are done
And a red card if you need help.

The exciting thing about our repository is that we actually include a reference to another repository.

So to get a copy of the child repository we need to tell git to update the local configuration files
with information about any referenced repositories.

```bash
git submodule init
```

**Question** Not trying to be personal, but can you init your submodules?

Hold up a green card when you are done
And a red card if you need help.

Once we've done that we tell git to fetch any referenced repositories.

```bash
git submodule update
```

**Question** Can you update your submodules?

Hold up a green card when you are done
And a red card if you need help.

What is this referenced repository, I hear you ask?

Well, to quote someone

-- *Slide* --

"I have a plan so cunning you could put a tail on it and call it a weasel"

AKA: [REVEAL.JS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/)

-- *Slide End* --

Reveal.js is a Javascript presentation framework. It's really cool

We have written a tool that that chunders through our lecture notes...

-- *Slide* --

`-- *Slide* --`

And any text between lines that have only the above marker

And finish with only the below marker

`-- *Slide End* --`

Is extracted into a lesson slide.

-- *Slide End* --

Demonstrate on the command line

```bash
ls  # show the jar and the properties file
java -jar SlideExtractor.jar # need to have Java. Talk about language choices  And VM choices!
open ./Presentation/Lesson_I.html  # show in browser
```

The reason for doing this was because it means that our slides and lecture notes all live in the same file.
Hence as we are working through them we can see what will be coming up next.
Also, it means that we don't have to maintain separate presentation material. We just have one file.

We've divided it into one file per lesson.

Now there's no need for you to generate the slides: we've checked the generated slides into the repository.

-- *Slide* --

## To give the lessons (basic)

* Clone the repository
* Update the repository submodules
* Choose the tag you want to use
* Optional: Update the introductory slide with your name
* Optional: Regenerate the slides
* Open the lesson slides in your browser!

-- *Slide End* --

BTW, I just print the lesson plans off of GitHub: which does a beautiful job of rendering the
markdown.

-- *Slide* --

## Can you open, say Lesson_II.html in your browser?

And step through some of the slides?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = Houston, we've had a problem here!

-- *Slide End* --

We've settled on the following way of managing the material:

There is a version number at the top of the README.md.
That version number corresponds to the last tagged copy.
If we are going to deliver the course and there are changes since the tagged copy given by the version number, we
create a new version and tag it.

This means that you should always be able to go back to a particular version in time.

-- *Slide* --

## What's the current version number?

1. 1.0.0
1. 1.0.1
1. 1.1.0
1. 1.1.1
1. 1.2.0

-- *Slide End* --


To see a list of tags

```bash
git tag
```

-- *Slide* --

## Can you list the tags?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

To see the commits between the last tag and now

```bash
git log --pretty=oneline master...1.0.0
```

You might have to explain the above command on a board...

-- *Slide* --

## Can you see if there are any commits since the last tag?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

It's good to check to see if there are any changes since the last tag: and if you want to include them
in your lessons or not.

If you have a set of notes for a particular version of the course, and that's what you want to
deliver you can checkout that particular tag and use it.

-- *Slide* --

## How to checkout a specific tag:

$ git checkout tags/<tag_name>

## Can you checkout version 1.0.0?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --


-- *Slide* --

## Did you get a "detached HEAD" warning?

### DON'T PANIC!

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

Git is just letting you know that your lessons are no longer on a branch, but on a previous commit.



# A walk through the course material


So as you can see, its a fairly formal course intended to be delivered by a person standing in front of a class.

But because this is a "Train the trainers" event, I am not going to give you this course.

Instead, we are going to do a higher level walk through.


As we work through this, I want you all to note any errors or changes that need to be done to the course material.

By raising issues!

At the end of the day you are going to get a chance to make changes by editing the files directly in the GitHub
repository.

So, without further ado, on to the first lesson. Find it in your browsers!

If you can't find it, hold up a Red sticky note, otherwise, a Green one to let me know you're ready to continue.

Is the paint video a better way to explain keys? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEBfamv-_do

# Course feedback

We have found the Software Carpentry technique of using sticky notes to be very handy.

To recap: at the end of a session, learners write one thing

* that they've learnt on their green sticky note
* that they found confusing on their red sticky note

# Tiny URL

http://bit.do/list-of-url-shorteners.php

# Preparation

You, the presenter, will need to:

* Have an AAF account
* Have checked the training material out of github
* Have a terminal of some kind that you can ssh into instances with

Before the day, send out an email message to attendees advising them of the prerequisites.

* Each learner will need a laptop with wifi access
* Do we need to deal with Chromebooks? Crosh Or Chrome Shell might be needed
* Each learner on the course must have an AAF logon.
* Each learner must have an allocation on the Research Cloud that they can use.

For those that have expired trial projects we can:

* get to pair up with others
* have a special tenancy for the lesson, and then them to it on the fly.
  This is not a great solution as people in the tenancy will step on each others toes.
* have someone on hand to extend their trial tenancies on the spot?

If we could get participants AAF credentials before hand, we could:

* pre-create a special allocation for each person on the course that dies the day after the course.
* run a query to check if they are part of any project, and the status of their project.


If you are going to stream people, send out a pre-assessment questionnaire

Find out about the venue. Does it have enough:

* Seats
* Tables
* Power points

Does the venue have:

* Network connectivity (wifi)
* Internet access
* A big display you can use
* A whiteboard (or paper) that you can draw on
* Pens (and cleaner for the whiteboard)

What kind of connectors do you need to bring along for your devices?

Do you have:

* Network connectivity (eg: are you banking on having EduRoam work for you, and have you tested that it is available
  and does indeed work for you...)
* Enough sticky notes, in two different colours, to hand out to attendees at the start
  and after each break
* A set of answer cards, enough for each learner, lettered 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' and 'E' respectively.
* All the required props?

Is the image named `res_os_drupal7` available and public on the NeCTAR cloud?
If so, check that it works as expected. Make a snapshot so that you hava a fall back image.
Have you checked the slides are all as you expect?

If it's not there, or doesn't work as expected, make a new image to use.

# Afterwards...

* Collate the feedback. Is any of it actionable?
* Remove users from a shared tenancy (if you had to add any)

# A discussion on delivering the course material


# How to contribute changes back to the course
