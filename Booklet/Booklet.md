## In the beginning was ResBaz

ResBaz (the [Research Bazaar](http://melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/)) is a campaign, a community and conference.

A campaign: to provide free peer to peer training on digital skills to researchers.
A community: to provide support to researchers through collaboration.
A conference: an annual 3 day multi city event to kick start the campaign and the community.

## We noticed

That an increasing number of researchers were turning to the cloud

## We realized

There was a training gap

## Hence

We developed a course

As ResBaz makes heavy use of Software Carpentry, we thought to emulate its style and practices.

We also came up with a conceit. A handle we call:

## ResOS

ResOS == Researcher Operating System

ResOS is simply metaphor to make it easy to communicate with the community on how a cloud operating system works
the same way that operating systems on laptops and mobile phones work.

Hopefully, everyone knows what an "operating system" is....

BTW, The engine which runs ResOS is called OpenStack.

# Software Carpentry: an overview

**NB** ResOS training is *not* a Software Carpentry course.

## History

Given that we based our training on we learnt from Software Carpentry, you should know a bit about Software Carpentry,
and the ideas behind it.

Software carpentry grew from the realization that researchers need to install and maintain software:
not only that - they need to occasionally write, debug and test it as well. Yet most researchers are
not taught to do this!

A course to tackle this problem was developed and run by Greg Wilson and Brent Gorda in 1998.

From the delivery of this course they learnt that:

-- *Slide* --

## Lesson 1

* Week long courses frazzle the attendees brains
* Textbook software development is not useful to researchers

-- *Slide End* --

Subsequent to this the course materials were put on line. Other iterations followed.

During this period it was realized that:

-- *Slide* --

## Lesson 2

* Most computer scientists don't have an interest in solving this problem
* The target market are people in the first few years of graduate school

-- *Slide End* --

MOOC style courses were also attempted. From this came the realization:

-- *Slide* --

## Lesson 3: The MOOC

* Video's are a huge amount of effort
* Most people don't complete the courses

-- *Slide End* --

After years of effort, review, and development, Software Carpentry now has the following format:

* A two day workshop
* Covering a small set of tools
* That introduce high level concepts
* With the goal of teaching computational competence

The following guidelines are in place

* No more than 40 people in a workshop
* If possible, parallel sessions, with attendees streamed by ability

If parallel sessions are run, then:

* A pre-assesment questionnaire is used to create the groups
* People are not swapped from group to group

The workshops aim to have:

* An instructor up front
* At least 1 helper per 8 attendees

Group sign up leads to better workshops and better attendance by under represented groups

## The following feedback loops are used:

Sticky notes are handed out to learners:

* two different colours (typically, Red and Green)
* used for true/false answers
* to show pain if not not coping
* and to signal that activies are completed

Minute cards:

Before each break the learners are asked to write one thing:

* that they've learnt on their green sticky note
* that they found confusing on their red sticky note

The instructor then collates these and incorporates the feedback into the next iteration.

Summary feedback at the end of the day:

Every attendee is asked to stand and to give one good point about the day, and one negative point,
without repeating what has already been said. The instructor makes notes and incorporates the
feedback into the next iteration.

Post workshop assessments:

After the workshop an assessment is sent to the attendees. These don't have high return rates.
Instructors are also requested to provide feedback in debriefing sessions.

## Delivery

* Live coding
* Two devices for the instructor
* An Etherpad session
* Learners work on their own machines
* Pair programming (so dinner table style rooms over lecture theaters)

## Biggest challenges

* Are they truly helping researchers?
* Diversity of learners - 20% bored, 20% lost :(
* People don't contribute back...

## So

Software carpentry has been under continuous iterative development for many years now. Along the
way the material has been reworked to take into account the latest in educational research and
feedback from the actual delivery.

BTW, Software Carpentry material is licenced under a creative commons logo. Anyone is free to use it.

**NB** But you are not free to use their name and logo! There are strict conditions applied to this. They
want to maintain their good name and reputation!

We feel that if you haven't done it yet, that you should sign up for their trainers course!

# Myths and truths about learning and education

Software Carpentry have mailing lists. And some of the discussions and books that are pointed to are
very interesting.

So lets get our sticky notes out and practice with some fun things we've learnt from the mailing lists.

-- *Slide* --

## People have different learning styles

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** False - it's true that we have preferred learning styles. But our preferred learning style
is probably not be our best learning style...

Further, learning styles are typically given a granular nature and labelled ("Visual!", "Auditory"), but us humans
actually form a continuum. Preparing lessons for a label short changes the continuum.

-- *Slide* --

## Physical activity helps learning

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** True - Activity makes for a healthy brain. Especially true for children!

-- *Slide* --

## Google makes learning obsolete!

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** False - Would you let a brain surgeon near you who going to Google every step of your operation along the way?
I wouldn't.

We need context and a mental structure to make sense of the facts we find on the Internet. Context and structure
we get from learning... In fact, given the amount of information available on the Internet we might need more
learning to make sense of it all!

-- *Slide* --

## Knowledge: as perishable as a fresh fish!

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** False - Is the knowledge that you have, somehow, in some strange quantum way, flipping from correct to wrong
with the passage of time?

Or is it simply that the knowledge available is exploding? Sure, some of the knowledge we may hold dear may turn out
to be incorrect (Carbs are good for you?), but the majority still holds true. Pythagoras still Rulez!

-- *Slide* --

## Discovery trumps explanation

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** True and False - Both sides have a point. If you can learn quantum physics by discovery: well, why are you
in this room? Research has shown that pure discovery learning doesn't work: but guided investigative learning can be
very effective in certain settings.

-- *Slide* --

## Memory records exactly what we experience...

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** False - Sadly it's been proved that not only is our memory of what we experience highly unreliable, it's even
posssible to plant false remembered experiences through clever questions.

-- *Slide* --

## BTW - who has seen this:

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vJG698U2Mvo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## We only use 10% of our brain...

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** False: If true, we should be able to survive the loss of 90% of our brain quite happily...

Also, modern scanning techniques have shown that this is false. Simple activities, such as walking into a room
full of people, or playing a musical instrument, cause all of your brain to light up!

# How learning works

Software Carpentry attempts to build on the findings of current research.

So:

## Analogies

Students learn new ideas by building on what they know.

This can be both a help and a hindrance.

A help if their existing knowledge is good.
A hindrance otherwise.

So our material must:

* Use analogies that students are likely to understand
* Introduce concepts in sequence, building on what has gone before

## Memory

From Working -> Long Term

Working memory has very limited capacity.

So our material:

* Can use scaffolding to reduce cognitive overload
* But must gradually remove scaffolding
* Should use multiple modalities (but don't split students attention)
* Must be well paced.

## Where did I put my keys?

What goes into memory often vanishes almost straight away

We can address this by

* Asking questions
* Telling stories
* Introducing mnemonics

## Practice is good

But not all practice is equivalent.

* Spaced practice is good
* Quizzes help
* Interleaving practice is more effective

## Feedback is needed

And it should be:

* Specific
* Clear
* Focused on the task
* Explanatory

## Why are we telling you all of this?

Well, we'd like you to help us improve the material in the course.

So we've created a checklist. As we work through the next section, please use the checklist

> "We are ... looking to find (and train) what we are calling a "power (researcher) users".

> Our investigation into these types of users produce the following kind of persona traits (which is whom we are aiming
> this "ResOS Train the Trainer curriculum").  "Power (Researcher) Users" are the types of researchers who see
> themselves as:
>
>* technically savvy (the person in the lab who everyone goes to for help);
>* they feel they are researcher first and foremost, e.g. they usually introduce themselves as "researchers" but are
>  very happy for their research colleagues to identify them as "technical".
>* sometimes these users are hired for their technical skills and identified as the research groups developer, but they
>  do have discipline expertise.
>* often they are a postgraduate or early career researcher; far too often they are male.
>* types of people who immediately un-installed the operating systems which the University provided them on their
>  laptop and replaced it with an OS which allowed them to have access to the "Utilities", "Settings" and
>  "Advanced Settings" of their Operating System.
>* they've even played around with installing Linux Ubuntu and other "command line" tasks.
>* while they understand the basics of installing an OS, it is only a means to an end so they can access more of the
>  research tools which get them and their colleagues results.
>* for them the cloud is just someone else's computer and they are only just willing to trust a computer the University
>  runs so long as no restrictions are made on them about how they use it (they are glad to go back to doing it
>  themselves if there are any barriers or bureaucracy put up by the University).


# Personas: an introduction

Now, break up into groups of 3-4 people.

The first exercise that I want you to do as a group is to develop a persona.

"What's a persona?" I think I hear you ask.

A persona is the representation of the goals and behaviour of a group of hypothetical users.

The theory is that by understanding the needs and abilities of that persona, you can better satisfy the needs and
abilities of the larger group.

A good persona should represent a skill set and a behaviour pattern - not a job description.

By example, here's a persona that I developed:

## An Astronomer at a University

**Name:**     Associate Professor Glenn Bording
**Job title:**     Senior researcher and lecturer, Radio Astronomy group

**Demographics:**

* 40 years old
* Programming experience in C and Fortran
* Basic HPC experience
* Prefers to work with physical hardware

**Background:**

* While preparing a new course for undergraduates, developed a computing challenge to support research using real data
* Realised the BYOD for most students were not powerful enough
* Labs not suitable for task
* Teaching parallel programming and getting accounts for students would be difficult
* Heard about the research cloud

**Goal:**

* Now keen to learn about ResOS to see if it solves this problem.

Once you, as a group, have agreed on your persona, hold up a green sticky note. But you'd better be quick, because
I'm giving you only 5 minutes!

Ok: for our purposes today, the persona's that you have developed represent the people that you will be explaining
our ResOS training course to.

So as we go through today I want each group to ask themselves just what it would take to communicate the concepts or
activities we are covering to this persona.

If you find you can't do it, then stop me, and we will all discuss it and see if we can come up with a better approach.

*Ask for one or two persona's to be read out*

# How to access the course material

# A walk through the course material

Is the paint video a better way to explain keys? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEBfamv-_do

# Preparation

Before the day, send out an email message to attendees advising them of the prerequisites.

* Each learner will need a laptop with wifi access
* Do we need to deal with Chromebooks? Crosh Or Chrome Shell might be needed
* Each learner on the course must have an AAF logon.
* Each learner must have an allocation on the Research Cloud that they can use.

For those that have expired trial projects we can:

* get to pair up with others
* have a special tenancy for the lesson, and then them to it on the fly.
  This is not a great solution as people in the tenancy will step on each others toes.
* have someone on hand to extend their trial tenancies on the spot?

If we could get participants AAF credentials before hand, we could:

* pre-create a special allocation for each person on the course that dies the day after the course.
* run a query to check if they are part of any project, and the status of their project.


If you are going to stream people, send out a pre-assessment questionnaire

Find out about the venue. Does it have enough:

* Seats
* Tables
* Power points

Does the venue have:

* Network connectivity (wifi)
* Internet access
* A big display you can use

What kind of connectors do you need to bring along for your devices?

Do you have:

* Enough sticky notes, in two different colours, to hand out to attendees at the start
  and after each break
* A set of answer cards, lettered 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' and 'E' respectively.

Is the image named `res_os_drupal7` available and public on the NeCTAR cloud?
If so, check that it works as expected. Make a snapshot so that you hava a fall back image.

If it's not there, or doesn't work as expected, make a new image to use.
