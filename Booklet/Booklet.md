## In the beginning was ResBaz

ResBaz (the [Research Bazaar](http://melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/)) is a campaign, a community and conference.

-- *Slide End* --

A campaign: to provide free peer to peer training on digital skills to researchers.
A community: to provide support to researchers through collaboration.
A conference: an annual 3 day multi city event to kick start the campaign and the community every year.

-- *Slide* --

## We noticed

That an increasing number of researchers were turning to the cloud

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## We realized

There was a training gap

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## Hence

We developed a course

-- *Slide End* --

We delivered an introduction to the NeCTAR cloud at ResBaz 2015 in Melbourne.

As ResBaz makes heavy use of Software Carpentry, we decided to emulate its style and practices.

## What is ResOS?

We also came up with a conceit. A handle we call:

ResOS == Researcher Operating System

A handle we have used to abstract away the mechanics of the cloud from researchers.

-- *Slide* --

## ResOS: what is it?

1. Researcher Open Source
1. Researcher Onion Storage
1. Researcher Open Storage
1. Researcher Operating System
1. A conceit

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer: D & E** I have such mixed feelings about this term. But it's one that some people have taken to heart.
So I'm putting it here just in case you talk to someone who uses it. Now you don't have to interrupt them to
find out what on earth they are talking about!

Subsequent to that initial ResBaz event we were commissioned to expand and enhance that material into a full day
hands on course.

So some of our foundations precede the online NeCTAR training material created by Intersect. We had to aligned
the two by changing our material. Which we were only able to do after Intersect published their training.

We've piloted all the material by giving lessons to small numbers of researchers, and solicited their feedback.

We are now using it in training at the University of Melbourne. And we will be changing it and
incorporating what we learn from delivering it as we go forward.

-- *Slide* --

# Software Carpentry: an overview

**NB** ResOS training is *not* a Software Carpentry course.

-- *Slide End* --

## History

Given that we based our training on we learnt from Software Carpentry, you should know a bit about Software Carpentry,
and the ideas behind it.

Software carpentry grew from the realization that researchers need to install and maintain software:
not only that - they need to occasionally write, debug and test it as well. Yet most researchers are
not taught to do this!

A course to tackle this problem was developed and run by Greg Wilson and Brent Gorda in 1998.

From the delivery of this course they learnt that:

-- *Slide* --

## Lesson 1

* Week long courses frazzle the attendees brains
* Textbook SLDC<sup><small>1</small></sup> is not useful to researchers

<small>1: [Software Development Life Cycle](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_overview.htm)</small>

-- *Slide End* --

**Discussion**  Try to have a discussion about the SLDC, and why this might be.

Subsequent to this the course materials were put on line. Other iterations followed.

During this period it was realized that:

-- *Slide* --

## Lesson 2

* Most computer scientists don't have an interest in training researchers
* The target market is new postgraduates

-- *Slide End* --

MOOC style courses were also attempted. From this came the realization:

-- *Slide* --

## Lesson 3: The MOOC<sup><small>1</small></sup>

* Video's are a huge amount of effort
* Most people don't complete the courses

<small>1: Massive Open Online Courses</small>

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## Who's done a MOOC?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes!
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No: why would I?

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## Who's finished all the MOOC's they have started?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes!
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = Life. Just keeps on interfering :(

-- *Slide End* --

After years of effort, review, and development, Software Carpentry now has the following format:

-- *Slide* --

## Format

* A two day workshop
* Covering a small set of tools
* That introduce high level concepts
* With the goal of teaching computational competence

-- *Slide End* --

The following guidelines are in place

-- *Slide* --

## Guidelines

* No more than 40 people in a workshop
* If possible, parallel sessions, with attendees streamed by ability

If parallel sessions are run, then:

* A pre-assesment questionnaire is used to create the groups
* People are not swapped from group to group

-- *Slide End* --

The workshops aim to have:

-- *Slide* --

## Staffing

* An instructor up front
* At least 1 roaming helper per 8 attendees

-- *Slide End* --

Group sign up leads to better workshops and better attendance by under represented groups

-- *Slide* --

## Feedback loops

* Sticky notes
* Minute cards
* Summary feedback
* Post workshop assesments

-- *Slide End* --

Extensive use is made of feedback loops. So:

Sticky notes are handed out to learners:

* two different colours (typically, Red and Green)
* used for true/false answers
* to show pain if not not coping
* and to signal that activities are completed

Minute cards:

Before each break the learners are asked to write one thing:

* that they've learnt on their green sticky note
* that they found confusing on their red sticky note

The instructor then collates these and incorporates the feedback into the next iteration.

Summary feedback at the end of the day:

Every attendee is asked to stand and to give one good point about the day, and one negative point,
without repeating what has already been said. The instructor makes notes and incorporates the
feedback into the next iteration.

Post workshop assessments:

After the workshop an assessment is sent to the attendees. These don't have high return rates.

Instructors are also requested to provide feedback in debriefing sessions.

-- *Slide* --

## To which we've added

* Multiple choice questions

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## Delivery

* Live coding
* Two devices for the instructor
* An Etherpad session
* Learners work on their own machines
* Pair programming (so dinner table style rooms over lecture theaters)

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## Biggest challenges

* Are they truly helping researchers?
* Diversity of learners - 20% bored, 20% lost :(
* People don't contribute back...

-- *Slide End* --

## So

Software carpentry has been under continuous iterative development for many years now. Along the
way the material has been reworked to take into account the latest in educational research and
feedback from the actual delivery.

BTW, Software Carpentry material is licenced under a creative commons licence. Anyone is free to use it.

**NB** But you are not free to use their name and logo! There are strict conditions applied to this. They
want to maintain their good name and reputation!

We feel that if you haven't done it yet, that you should sign up for their trainers course!

If you are going to be doing a lot of SW Carpentry style training consider subscribing...

-- *Slide End* --

I'm going to intersperse today with some fun things we've learnt from the mailing lists. So:

-- *Slide* --

## True or False: People have different learning styles

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** False - it's true that we have preferred learning styles. But our preferred learning style
is probably not be our best learning style...

Further, learning styles are typically given a granular nature and labelled ("Visual!", "Auditory"), but us humans
actually form a continuum. Preparing lessons for a label short changes the continuum.


# The format of the course material

We have elected to write our course material in Markdown.

-- *Slide* --

## Do you know what markdown is?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

**NB** If there are any "No's" you have to explain markdown...

The following may help:

HTML is simply text with tags in it.

**Demo:**

    <h1>A Heading</h1>
    <p>Paragraph text

Your browser parses the text and then renders it appropriately. But all those tags are a pain to type.
Hence markdown: the lazy way of generating HTML. You write:

    #A heading

    Paragraph text

And feed it into an engine, and out comes beautifully formed HTML.

-- *Slide* --

## Open the following sites in tabs:

* [http://tinyurl.com/ResOsLd](http://markdown-here.com/livedemo.html)
* [http://tinyurl.com/ResOsMd](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = I'm ready to proceed.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = What: there is no such site!

-- *Slide End* --

Pair up!

And see if you can produce the following well turned out html in the live demo site...

-- *Slide* --

# This is a heading

Followed by a **paragraph**

### and a subheading

* with a bullet
* list

```bash
# this is pretty printed bash code
ls -al
```

-- *Slide End* --

Hold up a green card when you are done

And a red card if you want help...

**Demonstrate** Show that you can type raw html into the markdown by adding

    <a href="http://www.nectar.org.au">Nectar</a>

## Tiny URL

There are URL's in our material. We do put them into the course Etherpads, but find that our learners don't
engage with the Etherpads. They kind of recoil in horror.

To work around this, and make it simple for learners to enter a url from the slide
we decided to use a URL shortner.

There are a lot of [url shortners out there](http://bit.do/list-of-url-shorteners.php).

We settled on [TinyURL.com](http://tinyurl.com)

For one simple reason: it was the first we found in which we could set the URL to be generated.

I believe, with no research behind me, that well selected human readable strings are easier to work with
than randomly generated characters.

-- *Slide* --

## Our url format

\[TinyURL\]\(The original url being shortened\)

-- *Slide End* --

We try to keep to this format for URL's in the material.

-- *Slide* --

## Why do use this format?

\[TinyURL\]\(The original url being shortened\)

1. Markdown mandates this format for url's
1. Developers like clarity
1. TinyURL might vanish!

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer: C**  Although it's been around for quite a while, we aren't sure that TinyURl will continue to be around.
It also helps us when reading the source material to see where the url is actually pointing.

-- *Slide* --

## Can you

Find a long link, and shorten it with http://tinyurl.com ?

Once done, enter it into the live demo site

* [http://tinyurl.com/ResOsLd](http://markdown-here.com/livedemo.html)

In our preferred format:

* \[TinyURL\]\(The original url being shortened\)

Then get your neighbour to check it for correctness.

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Done...
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = Please help us!

-- *Slide End* --

And that's about the level of markdown you need to know to work on and understand the training material.

-- *Slide* --

## True or False: Physical activity helps learning

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** True - Activity makes for a healthy brain. Especially true for children!


# How to access the course material

-- *Slide* --

## The repository can be found at:

* https://github.com/resbaz/nectar-cloud-lessons

Can you open this in your browser?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

## How we developed the course.

* We did a concept map on a board.
* Then we created a template for each lesson plan.
* We used the lesson plan to develop each lesson.
* We gave trial deliveries of each lesson to guinea pigs.
* We modified the lessons to match what we learnt from the trial delivery.

The lesson plans are in the repository, under the "Planning" folder. They give a high level overview of each of the
lessons.

-- *Slide* --

## Do you think we have kept the lesson plans up to date?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer:** We have tried. But like so much documentation in the software world, we struggle :(

But in getting to grips with a lesson, reading the lesson plan and ensuring that you understand the concepts
the lesson is attempting to convey is key.

-- *Slide* --

## Can you find and open the lesson plans?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

Follow along as we discuss the lessons.

## Lesson 1

We do a high level drive through of the dashboard: and keep the learners engaged by playing a game of follow my
leader: and by asking questions as we go. In the end the instructor launches an instance: but it's not intended
for the class to follow suite...

-- *Slide* --

## What's an ephemeral disk?

1. A quantum disk
1. A disk that moves from VM to VM
1. A disk that only exists for the life of its VM
1. A made up word set
1. Something victorians put their tea cups on

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer:** C. A disk that lives only for the lifetime of its associated VM.

-- *Slide* --

## What's a NeCTAR image?

1. A picture at an exhibition
1. A representation of NeCTAR
1. The general impression that NeCTAR presents to the world
1. A file that contains the contents of a hard drive
1. A piece in the NeCTAR art collection

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer:** D. A file that contains the contents of a hard drive.

-- *Slide* --

## No one really does anything in this lesson!

Is that a problem?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

Discuss that we've tried mixing lesson 1 and two up: and that we've had best success by introducing the concepts
and then the hands on work.

## Lesson 2

We get the students to create their own security group, keypair and then launch their own instance.

We scaffold this by giving them checklists to follow.

-- *Slide* --

## Our keypair analogy

Is it a problem?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## Is this better?

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YEBfamv-_do?start=138" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

## Lesson 3

Our most ambitious lesson so far!

We introduce the command line, ssh, sudo, package management and show security groups in action.

-- *Slide* --

## Our biggest problem...

The amazing teleporting terminal!

-- *Slide End* --

Hence our increasingly laboured explanations around terminals...

-- *Slide* --

## Our ssh analogy

Is it a problem? (note that the video allows us to remove this analogy)

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

Can anyone think of a better one?

-- *Slide* --

## Our man in the middle analogy

Is it a problem?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

We are finding it more fun to do a play with one of the helpers playing out the roll of the man in the middle:
and no envelopes!


## Lesson 4

We get our learners to use scp and cyberduck to move data to and from their remote machines.

-- *Slide* --

## Moving data: our top researcher request!

Hence it's worth spending time on...

-- *Slide End* --

## Lesson 5

We launch and run graphical applications via xwindows over ssh.

-- *Slide* --

## Graphical applications: our top promoter request!

Of interest...

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## X-Windows

Where's the server?

1. On the users workstation
1. On the remote VM
1. Does it matter?

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer:** A, in our case. We don't really dive into this, just because of the amount of confusion
it can engender.

## Lesson 6

We dive deeper into snapshots and scaling.

-- *Slide* --

## Why are NeCTAR snapshots are broken?

1. They are just too easy to do: suspicious enough!
1. The magic nostrums aren't up to the task!
1. They are not broken! How dare you!
1. The state of the machine is not captured
1. Cosmic rays can flip their bits.

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer:** D. Whilst E is a topic for a good debate, the answer is: D. The state of the machine is not captured

This seems to be a little known fact :(

We teach a work around that gives faultless snapshots.

-- *Slide* --

## Anyone care to guess our technique?

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer:** Yes, we shut the VM down. Note: Not terminate!!

-- *Slide* --

## Do you know the differences between:

1. A soft reboot of a VM
1. A terminated VM
1. A paused VM
1. A stopped VM
1. A hard reboot of a VM

###?

-- *Slide End* --

A paused VM is simply halted in memory, ready to be started again.
A stopped VM has its state written to the host machines disk, ready to be resumed from there.
A soft reboot tries to do a graceful reboot (you ask the OS to reboot).
A hard reboot just reboots the machine! (you press the button)

## Lesson 7

We have a very clumsy display that transient storage is not to be relied on.

And also do some vertical scaling and public sharing of snapshots.

-- *Slide* --

## Vertical scaling: an often featured support request.

Strangely, people want to keep their IP numbers...

-- *Slide End* --

## Lesson 8

We dive into the Object Store

It's a very simple lesson.


-- *Slide* --

## True or False: Knowledge is as perishable as a fresh fish!

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** False - Is the knowledge that you have, somehow, in some strange quantum way, flipping from correct to wrong
with the passage of time?

Or is it simply that the knowledge available is exploding? Sure, some of the knowledge we may hold dear may turn out
to be incorrect (Carbs are good for you?), but the majority still holds true. Pythagoras still Rulez!

## Lesson 9

We dive into Security

This the messiest and least explored lesson, as you'll be able to tell by the lesson plan and the lesson.

-- *Slide* --

## True or False: Discovery trumps explanation

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** True and False - Both sides have a point. If you can learn quantum physics by discovery: well, why are you
in this room? Research has shown that pure discovery learning doesn't work: but guided investigative learning can be
very effective in certain settings.

## Git

As you can see the course material is kept under version control.

-- *Slide* --

## Do you know what git is?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

**NB** If there are any "No's" you have to explain git...

The following may help you:

* https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control
* https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics
* http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html
* https://matthew-brett.github.io/pydagogue/curious_git.html

-- *Slide* --

## Which of these is false:

Git:

1. Is a version control system
1. Is a distributed version control system
1. Is able to run offline
1. Has three states for files: modified, staged, committed
1. Can do your head in...

-- *Slide End* --

Discuss each of these options further before asking for the answer.
For Option E you can use this:

"*Git has a very simple and powerful underlying model. Atop this model is piled an immense trashheap of confusing,
overlapping, inconsistent commands. If you try to just learn what commands to run in what order, your life will be
miserable, because none of the commands make sense. Learning the underlying model has a much better payoff because
it is much easier to understand what is really going on underneath than to try to infer it, Sherlock-Holmes style,
from the top.*" - [Mark Dominus](http://blog.plover.com/prog/two-things-about-git.html)

**Answer** I believe them all to be true...

Any confusion here should require further discussion...

Not only is the course material kept under version control: that version control is accessible via an online
repository, so you can revisit it at any time, use it as a stand alone course if you want to, and even, hopefully,
contributes changes and extensions back!

To check it out we do the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/resbaz/nectar-cloud-lessons.git
```

**Question** Can you check the lessons out?

Hold up a green card when you are done
And a red card if you need help.

The exciting thing about our repository is that we actually include a reference to another repository.

So to get a copy of the child repository we need to tell git to update the local configuration files
with information about any referenced repositories.

```bash
git submodule init
```

**Question** Not trying to be personal, but can you init your submodules?

Hold up a green card when you are done
And a red card if you need help.

Once we've done that we tell git to fetch any referenced repositories.

```bash
git submodule update
```

**Question** Can you update your submodules?

Hold up a green card when you are done
And a red card if you need help.

What is this referenced repository, I hear you ask?

Well, to quote someone

-- *Slide* --

"I've got a plan so cunning, you could put a tail on it and call it a weasel<sup><small>1</small></sup>"

AKA: [REVEAL.JS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/)

<small>1: [Blackadder](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Blackadder)</small>

-- *Slide End* --

Reveal.js is a Javascript presentation framework. It's really cool

We have written a tool that that chunders through our lecture notes...

-- *Slide* --

# SlideExtractor.jar

`-- *Slide* --`

In the lessons any text between lines that have only the above marker

And finish with only the below marker

`-- *Slide End* --`

Will extracted into a lesson slide.

-- *Slide End* --

Demonstrate on the command line

```bash
ls  # show the jar and the properties file
java -jar SlideExtractor.jar # need to have Java. Talk about language choices  And VM choices!
open ./Presentation/Lesson_I.html  # show in browser
```

The reason for doing this was because it means that our slides and lecture notes all live in the same file.
Hence as we are working through them we can see what will be coming up next.
Also, it means that we don't have to maintain separate presentation material. We just have one file.

We've divided it into one file per lesson.

Now there's no need for you to generate the slides: we've checked the generated slides into the repository.

-- *Slide* --

## To give the lessons (basic)

* Clone the repository
* Update the repository submodules
* Optional: Checkout the tag you want to deliver
* Optional: Update the introductory slide with your name
* Optional: Regenerate the slides
* Open the lesson slides in your browser!

-- *Slide End* --

BTW, I just print the lesson plans off of GitHub: which does a beautiful job of rendering the
markdown.

-- *Slide* --

## Can you open, say Lesson_II.html in your browser?

And step through some of the slides?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = Houston, we've had a problem here!

-- *Slide End* --

We've settled on the following way of managing the material:

There is a version number at the top of the README.md.
That version number corresponds to the last tagged copy.
If we are going to deliver the course and there are changes since the tagged copy given by the version number, we
create a new version and tag it.

This means that you should always be able to go back to a particular version in time.

-- *Slide* --

## What's the current version number?

1. 1.0.0
1. 1.0.1
1. 1.1.0
1. 1.1.1
1. 1.2.0

-- *Slide End* --

To see a list of tags

```bash
git tag
```

-- *Slide* --

## Can you list the tags?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

To see the commits between the last tag and now

```bash
git log --pretty=oneline master...1.0.0
```

You might have to explain the above command on a board...

-- *Slide* --

## Are there are any commits since the last tag?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

It's good to check to see if there are any changes since the last tag: and if you want to include them
in your lessons or not.

If you have a set of notes for a particular version of the course, and that's what you want to
deliver you can checkout that particular tag and use it.

-- *Slide* --

## How to checkout a specific tag as a local branch:

```bash
$ git checkout tags/<tag_name> -b <tag_name>
```

## Can you checkout version 1.0.0?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## True or False: Google makes learning obsolete!

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** False - Would you let a brain surgeon near you who going to Google every step of your operation along the way?
I wouldn't...

We need context and a mental structure to make sense of the facts we find on the Internet. Context and structure
we get from learning... In fact, given the amount of information available on the Internet we might need more
learning to make sense of it all!

# Personas: an introduction

Now, break up into groups of 3-4 people.

The first exercise that I want you to do as a group is to develop a persona.

"What's a persona?" I think I hear you ask.

A persona is the representation of the goals and behaviour of a group of hypothetical users.

The theory is that by understanding the needs and abilities of that persona, you can better satisfy the needs and
abilities of the larger group.

A good persona should represent a skill set and a behaviour pattern - not a job description.

By example, here's a persona that I developed:

-- *Slide* --
**Name:**  Associate Professor Glenn Bording

**Job title:**  Senior researcher and lecturer, Radio Astronomy group

**Demographics:**

* 40 years old
* Programming experience in C and Fortran
* Basic HPC experience
* Prefers to work with physical hardware

-- *Slide End* --
-- *Slide* --

**Background:**

* While preparing a new course for undergraduates, developed a computing challenge to support research using real data
* Realised the BYOD for most students were not powerful enough
* Labs not suitable for task
* Teaching parallel programming and getting accounts for students would be difficult
* Heard about the research cloud

**Goal:**

* Now keen to learn about ResOS to see if it solves this problem.

-- *Slide End* --

Once you, as a group, have agreed on your persona, hold up a green sticky note. But you'd better be quick, because
I'm giving you only 5 minutes!

For more on personas, there is the [wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_%28user_experience%29) and of
course, the book [The Inmates are Running the Asylum](http://www.amazon.com/The-Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum/dp/0672326140).
Also, the blog posting [Perfecting Your Persona's](http://www.cooper.com/journal/2001/08/perfecting_your_personas)
And dont' forget: [Software Carpentry's Personas](http://software-carpentry.org/audience/).

Ok: for our purposes today, the persona's that you have developed represent the people that you will be delivering
our ResOS training course to.

So as we go through the rest of today I want each group to ask themselves just what it would take to communicate
the concepts or  activities we are covering to this persona.

If you find you can't do it, then stop me, and we will all discuss it and see if we can come up with a better approach.

**Ask for one or two persona's to be read out**


# A walk through the course material


So as you have learnt, its a fairly formal course intended to be delivered by a person standing in front of a class.

But because this is a "Train the trainers" event, I am not going to give you this course.

Instead, we are going to do a higher level walk through.

As we work through this, I want you all to note any errors or changes that need to be done to the course material.

By raising issues!

-- *Slide* --

# Do you know how to raise an issue on GitHub?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

If there are any No's: well, they need to be shown!

So, without further ado, on to the first lesson. Find it in your browsers!

If you can't find it, hold up a Red sticky note, otherwise, a Green one to let me know you're ready to continue.

-- *Slide* --

## True or False: Memory records exactly what we experience...

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** False - Sadly it's been proved that not only is our memory of what we experience highly unreliable, it's even
possible to plant false remembered experiences through clever questions.

-- *Slide* --

## BTW - who has seen this:

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vJG698U2Mvo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --

## True or False: We only use 10% of our brain...

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** False: If true, we should be able to survive the loss of 90% of our brain quite happily...

Also, modern scanning techniques have shown that this is false. Simple activities, such as walking into a room
full of people, or playing a musical instrument, cause all of your brain to light up!

# Course feedback

We have found the Software Carpentry technique of using sticky notes to be very handy.
And the multi-choice questions also give a really good idea as to who needs more explanation. They also allow
us to break up the proceedings with some humour.

The multi choice question answer cards are a real pain to manage and distribute. Having each answer a different
colour works really well in allowing us to see who has answered what without having to read the cards.

We've also found that the use of minute cards is brilliant:

To recap: at the end of a session, learners write one thing

* that they've learnt on their green sticky note
* that they found confusing on their red sticky note

## Sample feedback from a course

### Voyeurs!

-- *Slide End* --

Instructor feedback is also something we practice.

Although I suspect that this might be largely self affirming. In which case do we get value from it?

The post workshop assessment is another practice that the University follows.

To do this we use the Net Promoter Score metric.

We send out an email customized to the session, along the lines of:

-- *Slide* --

Thank you so much for attending the basic high performance computing with NeCTAR course yesterday.

If you haven’t done so already, please take two minutes to fill out this anonymous two-question survey on how you felt the training went:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18-FVw2R3svRyh6AE4ropHcors0wc50tqoBX5R5dUOOoo/viewform

For those of you who asked for more links to material on the cloud side:

We covered the basic concepts:

-- *Slide End* --

When the learners click on the link they see the following Google form:

-- *Slide* --

### Feedback form

![The post workshop assessment form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinPaulo/ResOsTrainTheTrainer/master/Booklet/PostCourseFollowUp.png "NPS Form")

-- *Slide End* --

The form asks for one question on a numeric scale to be answered. Those who answer

* 9 - 10 are  seen as promoters
* 7 -8 are seen as passive
* Everything below this is seen as being detractors.

We haven't trialed summary feedback yet :(


# Preparation

You, the presenter, will need to:

* Have an AAF account
* Have checked the training material out of github
* Have a terminal of some kind that you can ssh into instances with

Before the day, send out an email message to attendees advising them of the prerequisites.

* Each learner will need a laptop with wifi access
* Do we need to deal with Chromebooks? Crosh Or Chrome Shell might be needed
* Each learner on the course must have an AAF logon.
* Each learner must have an allocation on the Research Cloud that they can use.

For those that have expired trial projects we can:

* get to pair up with others
* have a special tenancy for the lesson, and then them to it on the fly.
  This is not a great solution as people in the tenancy will step on each others toes.
* have someone on hand to extend their trial tenancies on the spot?

If we could get participants AAF credentials before hand, we could:

* pre-create a special allocation for each person on the course that dies the day after the course.
* run a query to check if they are part of any project, and the status of their project.


If you are going to stream people, send out a pre-assessment questionnaire

Find out about the venue. Does it have enough:

* Seats
* Tables
* Power points

Does the venue have:

* Network connectivity (wifi)
* Internet access
* A big display you can use
* A whiteboard (or paper) that you can draw on
* Pens (and cleaner for the whiteboard)

What kind of connectors do you need to bring along for your devices?

Do you have:

* Network connectivity (eg: are you banking on having EduRoam work for you, and have you tested that it is available
  and does indeed work for you...)
* Enough sticky notes, in two different colours, to hand out to attendees at the start
  and after each break
* A set of answer cards, enough for each learner, lettered 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' and 'E' respectively.
* A set of three envelopes, at least one of which fits inside the other two, to describe ssh and man in the middle
  attacks.
* Any other required props?

Is the image named `res_os_drupal7` available and public on the NeCTAR cloud?
If so, check that it works as expected. Make a snapshot so that you hava a fall back image.
Have you checked the slides are all as you expect?

If it's not there, or doesn't work as expected, make a new image to use.

# Afterwards...

* Collate the feedback. Is any of it actionable?
* Remove users from a shared tenancy (if you had to add any)

# A discussion on delivering the course material


# How to contribute changes back to the course

## How learning works

Software Carpentry attempts to build on the findings of current research.

So:

-- *Slide* --

## Analogies

Students learn new ideas by building on what they know.

-- *Slide End* --

This can be both a help and a hindrance.

A help if their existing knowledge is good.
A hindrance otherwise.

So our material must:

* Use analogies that students are likely to understand
* Introduce concepts in sequence, building on what has gone before

-- *Slide* --

## Memory

From Working -> Long Term

-- *Slide End* --

Working memory has very limited capacity.

So our material:

* Can use scaffolding to reduce cognitive overload
* But must gradually remove scaffolding
* Should use multiple modalities (but don't split students attention)
* Must be well paced.


-- *Slide* --

## Where did I put my keys?

What goes into memory often vanishes almost straight away

-- *Slide End* --

We can address this by

* Asking questions
* Telling stories
* Introducing mnemonics

-- *Slide* --

## Practice is good

But not all practice is equivalent.

-- *Slide End* --

* Spaced practice is good
* Quizzes help
* Interleaving practice is more effective

-- *Slide* --

## Feedback is needed

And it should be:

* Specific
* Clear
* Focused on the task
* Explanatory

-- *Slide End* --

## Why are we telling you all of this?

Well, we'd like you to help us improve the material in the course.

So we've created a checklist. As we work through the next section, please use the checklist
