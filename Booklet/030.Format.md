# The format of the course material

We have elected to write our course material in Markdown.

-- *Slide* --

### Do you know what markdown is?

* <span style="color:white;background:green">G</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:white;background:red">R</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

**NB** If there are any "No's" you have to explain markdown...

The following may help:

HTML is simply text with tags in it.

**Demo:**

    <h1>A Heading</h1>
    <p>Paragraph text

Your browser parses the text and then renders it appropriately. But all those tags are a pain to type.
Hence markdown: the lazy way of generating HTML. You write:

    #A heading

    Paragraph text

And feed it into an engine, and out comes beautifully formed HTML.

-- *Slide* --

### Open the following sites in tabs:

* [http://tinyurl.com/ResOsLd](http://markdown-here.com/livedemo.html)
* [http://tinyurl.com/ResOsMd](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)

* <span style="color:white;background:green">G</span> = I'm ready to proceed.
* <span style="color:white;background:red">R</span> = What: there is no such site!

-- *Slide End* --

Pair up!

And see if you can produce the following well turned out html in the live demo site...

-- *Slide* --

# This is a heading

Followed by a **paragraph**

### and a subheading

* with a bullet
* list

```bash
# this is pretty printed bash code
ls -al
```

-- *Slide End* --

Hold up a green card when you are done

And a red card if you want help...

**Demonstrate** Show that you can type raw html into the markdown by adding

    <a href="http://www.nectar.org.au">NeCTAR</a>

## Tiny URL

We wanted to make it simple for learners to enter a url from the slides, so
we decided to use a URL shortner.

There are a lot of [url shortners out there](http://bit.do/list-of-url-shorteners.php).

We settled on [TinyURL.com](http://tinyurl.com)

For one simple reason: it was the first we found in which we could set the URL to be generated.

I believe, with no research behind me, that well selected human readable strings are easier to work with
than randomly generated characters.

-- *Slide* --

### Our url format

\[TinyURL\]\(The original url being shortened\)

-- *Slide End* --

We try to keep to this format for URL's in the material.

-- *Slide* --

### Why do we use this format?

\[TinyURL\]\(The original url being shortened\)

1. Markdown mandates this format for url's
1. Developers like clarity
1. TinyURL might vanish!

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer: C**  Although it's been around for quite a while, we aren't sure that TinyURl will continue to be around.
It also helps us when reading the source material to see where the shortened url is actually pointing.

-- *Slide* --

### Can you

Find a long link, and shorten it with http://tinyurl.com ?

Once done, enter it into the Markdown Here live demo site

* [http://tinyurl.com/ResOsLd](http://markdown-here.com/livedemo.html)

In our preferred format:

* \[TinyURL\]\(The original url being shortened\)

Then get your neighbour to check it for correctness.

* <span style="color:white;background:green">G</span> = Done...
* <span style="color:white;background:red">R</span> = Please help us!

-- *Slide End* --

And that's about the level of markdown you need to know to work on and understand the training material.

-- *Slide* --

### True or False: Physical activity helps learning

* <span style="color:white;background:green">G</span> = True.
* <span style="color:white;background:red">R</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** True - Activity makes for a healthy brain. Especially true for children!
