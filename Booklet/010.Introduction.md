### In the beginning was ResBaz

ResBaz (the [Research Bazaar](http://melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/)) is a campaign, a community and conference.

-- *Slide End* --

* A campaign: to provide free peer to peer training on digital skills to researchers.
* A community: to provide support to researchers through collaboration.
* A conference: an annual 3 day multi city event to kick start the campaign and the community every year.

### We noticed

That an increasing number of researchers were turning to the cloud

### We realized

There was a training gap

-- *Slide* --

### Hence

We developed a course

-- *Slide End* --

We delivered an introduction to the NeCTAR cloud at ResBaz 2015 in Melbourne.

As ResBaz makes heavy use of Software Carpentry, we decided to emulate its style and practices.

## What is ResOS?

We also came up with a conceit. A handle we call:

ResOS == Researcher Operating System

A handle we have used to abstract away the mechanics of the cloud from researchers.

### ResOS: what is it?

1. Researcher Open Source
1. Researcher Onion Storage

**Answer: D & E** I have such mixed feelings about this term. But it's one that some people have taken to heart.
So I'm putting it here just in case you talk to someone who uses it. Now you don't have to interrupt them to
find out what on earth they are talking about!

Subsequent to that initial ResBaz event we were commissioned by NeCTAR to expand and enhance that material into a
full day hands on course.

So some of our foundations precede the online NeCTAR training material created by Intersect. We had to aligned
the two by changing our material. Which we were only able to do after Intersect published their training.

We've piloted all the material by giving lessons to small numbers of researchers, and solicited their feedback.

We are now using it in training at the University of Melbourne. And we will be changing it and
incorporating what we learn from delivering it as we go forward.
