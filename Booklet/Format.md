# The format of the course material

We have elected to write our course material in Markdown.

-- *Slide* --

### Do you know what markdown is?

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No.

-- *Slide End* --

**NB** If there are any "No's" you have to explain markdown...

The following may help:

HTML is simply text with tags in it.

**Demo:**

    <h1>A Heading</h1>
    <p>Paragraph text

Your browser parses the text and then renders it appropriately. But all those tags are a pain to type.
Hence markdown: the lazy way of generating HTML. You write:

    #A heading

    Paragraph text

And feed it into an engine, and out comes beautifully formed HTML.

-- *Slide* --

### Open the following sites in tabs:

* [http://tinyurl.com/ResOsLd](http://markdown-here.com/livedemo.html)
* [http://tinyurl.com/ResOsMd](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = I'm ready to proceed.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = What: there is no such site!

-- *Slide End* --

Pair up!

And see if you can produce the following well turned out html in the live demo site...

-- *Slide* --

# This is a heading

Followed by a **paragraph**

### and a subheading

* with a bullet
* list

```bash
# this is pretty printed bash code
ls -al
```

-- *Slide End* --

Hold up a green card when you are done

And a red card if you want help...

**Demonstrate** Show that you can type raw html into the markdown by adding

    <a href="http://www.nectar.org.au">Nectar</a>

## Tiny URL

There are URL's in our material. We do put them into the course Etherpads, but find that our learners don't
engage with the Etherpads. They kind of recoil in horror.

-- *Slide* --

### An Etherpad from one of our courses...

https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/NeCTAR_Cloud_1.0.1

-- *Slide End* --

To work around this, and make it simple for learners to enter a url from the slide
we decided to use a URL shortner.

There are a lot of [url shortners out there](http://bit.do/list-of-url-shorteners.php).

We settled on [TinyURL.com](http://tinyurl.com)

For one simple reason: it was the first we found in which we could set the URL to be generated.

I believe, with no research behind me, that well selected human readable strings are easier to work with
than randomly generated characters.

-- *Slide* --

### Our url format

\[TinyURL\]\(The original url being shortened\)

-- *Slide End* --

We try to keep to this format for URL's in the material.

-- *Slide* --

### Why do we use this format?

\[TinyURL\]\(The original url being shortened\)

1. Markdown mandates this format for url's
1. Developers like clarity
1. TinyURL might vanish!

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer: C**  Although it's been around for quite a while, we aren't sure that TinyURl will continue to be around.
It also helps us when reading the source material to see where the shortened url is actually pointing.

-- *Slide* --

### Can you

Find a long link, and shorten it with http://tinyurl.com ?

Once done, enter it into the live demo site

* [http://tinyurl.com/ResOsLd](http://markdown-here.com/livedemo.html)

In our preferred format:

* \[TinyURL\]\(The original url being shortened\)

Then get your neighbour to check it for correctness.

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Done...
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = Please help us!

-- *Slide End* --

And that's about the level of markdown you need to know to work on and understand the training material.

### True or False: Physical activity helps learning

* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = True.
* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = False.

-- *Slide End* --

**A** True - Activity makes for a healthy brain. Especially true for children!
